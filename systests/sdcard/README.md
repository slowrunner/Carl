SD Card Tests

== install
sudo apt install agnostics

== run


run the speed test on newly-formatted SD cards 
because running it on one that's already stuffed with data 
will likely return results that aren't indicative of its potential speed 
once it's been erased and reformatted. 

The result is delivered as either a "Pass" or a "fail". 

"The pass / fail criteria in this test assume a new 
(or at least freshly formatted) card; 
don't be alarmed if the write speed test fails 
when run on the SD card you've been using for six months! 

If you do notice your Raspberry Pi slowing down over time, 
it may be worth backing up your SD card using the SD Card Copier tool and reformatting it," 
explains Raspberry Pi senior principal software engineer Simon Long.
