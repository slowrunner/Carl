To troubleshoot the GoPiGo3
----------------------------

If the GoPiGo3 is not performing as expected, here are some things to try:

* Run the troubleshooting script `all_tests.sh`. Look through the output to
  see if there's anything unexpected. If you don't find the problem, you can
  upload the `log.txt` file from the desktop (`/home/pi/Desktop/log.txt`) to
  the [forums] and ask for help (please give a clear description of the problem
  you're experiencing). You can run the troubleshooting script by running this:

        sudo bash /home/pi/Dexter/GoPiGo3/Troubleshooting/all_tests.sh
