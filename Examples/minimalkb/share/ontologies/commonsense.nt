In the context of the OpenRobotOntology, doers of an action are as a matter of fact instances to Agent_PartiallyTangible (q.v.), even if they may not be in a broader context (e.g. a falling rock that dents a car's roof). Depending upon the context, doers of actions might be animate or inanimate, conscious or nonconscious.

Each instance of EnduringThing_Localized is a spatial enduring thing at which an event can occur or a situation can obtain. Positive examples include planets, the borders between countries, human beings, rocks, and atoms. Negative example include situations, events, abstract objects, and regions of space that exclusively act as possible locations for other spatial objects (see SpaceRegion). An important specialization of EnduringThing_Localized is Place (q.v.). The salient distinction between places (instances of Place) and locations (instances of EnduringThing_Localized) is that places are assumed to have relatively permanent locations, whereas locations need not have permanent locations. Thus, from the perspective of someone standing on a beach, the crest of a breaking wave can be a location at which foaming is occuring (thus an EnduringThing_Localized), but it cannot be such a place (i.e. it cannot be an instance of Place)."

Note that to say that an entity is a member of this collection is to remain agnostic about two issues. First, a SpatialThing may be PartiallyTangible (e.g. Texas-State) or wholly Intangible (e.g. ArcticCircle or a line mentioned in a geometric theorem). Second, although we do insist on location relative to another spatial thing or in some embedding space, a SpatialThing might or might not be located in the actual physical universe. It is far from clear that all SpatialThings are so located: an ideal platonic circle or a trajectory through the phase space of some physical system (e.g.) might not be. If the intent is to imply location in the empirically observable cosmos, the user should employ this collection's specialization, SpatialThing-Localized."

Also included are those events that can be pinned-down to specific places (see Event-Localized), and thus all PhysicalEvents. Excluded from this collection are any SpatialThings that are not localized, such as -- arguably -- purely abstract geometrical figures (e.g. a Platonic sphere).\n\nNote that a fictional or imaginary object (such as Frodo, Captain Queeg, or HAL9000-TheComputer) is typically localized with respect to the universe of the fictional/imagnary context in which it is found, and so is an instance of SpatialThing-Localized with respect to that context."
