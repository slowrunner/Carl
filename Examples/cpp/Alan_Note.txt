Setting up to compile C++ programs for GoPiGo3

1) mkdir for the cpp stuff:
  mkdir  /home/pi/Carl/Examples/cpp
  mkdir  /home/pi/Carl/Examples/cpp/out
  
2) copy the Dexter cpp examples:
  cp -r /home/pi/Dexter/GoPiGo3/Software/C/* cpp
3) install cmake:
  sudo apt-get install cmake
4) run cmake to build make files
  /home/pi/Carl/Examples/cpp$  cmake CMakeLists.txt
5) run make to build the examples and the libgopigo3.so link library
  make
6) try out the motors executable:
  ./motors
7) If it works, copy the executable to ./out (folder added to .gitignore)   
8) Clean up the folder
  make clean
  
  
9) to compile a new file e.g. robot.cpp, put it in Examples/cpp/robots/
  mkdir /home/pi/Carl/Examples/cpp/robots
10) add to CMakeLists.txt
   # robot
   add_executable(robot robots/robot.cpp)
   target_link_libraries(robot gopigo3)
11)  create a make file for the new program
    cmake CMakeLists.txt
12) compile and link the new executable
    make
13) run the executable
    ./robot
