Test Procedure:

1) Record test audio of 10 phrases of various length (input_file.txt):
	arecord -f s16_LE -r 16000 test16k.wav
	Speak: 
		Hello
		What Time is it
		Drive Forward Slowly
		Who do you think will win the election
		What is the weather forecast
		How long have you been running
		Turn forty five degrees left
		one two three four five six seven eight nine ten
		a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
		Goodbye

2) Run large LM PocketSphinx on the recording in one remote ssh, run top in another (%CPU %Mem)
	pocketsphinx_continuous -infile test16k.wav 2>&1 | tee ./psphinx.log
	(note power consumption A during and after reco)

3) Extract Performance Data (xRT)
	./perf.sh >result_Pi<model>_file.log

4) Extract recognized phrases
	tail -14 >reco_Pi<model>_file.log
