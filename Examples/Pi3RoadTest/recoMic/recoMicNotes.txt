Test Procedure:


5) Run PocketSphinx from microphone with small LM, speak 10 in-model phrases
 	python mymain.py 
	(note power consumption A during and after program)
	(note %CPU %Mem from top during program execution)
	Speak: 
		Hello
		What Time is it
		Drive Forward Slowly
		How long have you been running
		Turn forty five degrees left
		Go backward quickly
		Is it going to rain
		Spin
		Stop now
		sudo shutdown minus H now

6) Copy term output to LMsmall_Pi<model>.log

7) Extract Performance Data (xRT)
	./perf.sh >result_Pi<model>_10.txt

8) Run PocketSphinx from microphone with medium JSGF grammar, speak 10 in-grammar phrases.
	(note power consumption A during and after program)
	(note %CPU %Mem from top during program execution)
	Speak: 
		Hello
		What Time is it
		Drive Forward Slowly
		How long have you been running
		Turn forty five degrees left
		Go backward quickly
		Is it going to rain
		Spin
		Stop
		sudo shutdown minus H now

9) Copy term output to jsgf_Pi<model>.log

	Pi B+: 	top 90% CPU 5% memory, 0.45A  (+0.13A)
		4 word substitutions, 9 deletion, 0 insertions = 13 errors / 35 words 
		= 37% Word Error Rate WER
		3.075 xRT reported Total CPU xRT ( sum fwdtree, fwdflat, and bestpath calculations)
Pi 3:  top 100% CPU 3% memory, 0.49A (+0.18A)
		0 word substitutions, 0 deletion, 0 insertions = 0 errors / 67 words 
		= 0% Word Error Rate WER
		0.826 xRT reported Total CPU xRT (sum fwdtree, fwdflat, and bestpath)  

3) pocketsphinx python using microphone input and medium grammar:
	Pi B+: 	1 word substitution, 0 deletion, 0 insertions = 1 error / 34 words 
		= 3% Word Error Rate WER

Pi 3: 	0 word substitutions, 0 deletion, 0 insertions = 0 errors / 34 words 
		= 0% Word Error Rate WER
