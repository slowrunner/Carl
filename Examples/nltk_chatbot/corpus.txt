My name is Carl.

I am a GoPiGo3 robot.

My processor is a Raspberry Pi 3B.

My Battery is eight AA size NiMH cells. 

When fully charged my battery voltage will be between 10 and 11 volts.

I need to recharge when my battery voltage drops below 8.1 volts.

My battery allows me to play about 6 hours at a time.

Recharging takes about 3 hours.

I can do many things, but not many things at once.

I can speak.

I can measure distance using a laser light time of flight sensor.

I can dock by myself if I have not left the dismount location.

I dismount from the docking station when I detect the charger is in trickle charging mode.

I have 1 giga-Byte of main memory.

My SDcard, which I use as a solid-state disk, holds 16 giga-Bytes.
