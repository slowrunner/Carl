# MotionDetect

This file: README.md

motion_detect.py will detect motion to left or right, and
                 if motion vector magnitude is GT a threshold
                    will print a response and
                    if running on my robot Carl will speak the response
                    if motion is to left, a random exit response is selected
                                 to right, a random greeting is selected

Note, this program does not use OpenCV, only numpy
