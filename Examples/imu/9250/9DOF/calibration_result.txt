First Run:
Calibration complete:
	magXbias = 172.617

=== running magCalSlider.py

Had to upgrade matplotlib (was v2.0.0, upgraded to v3.0.3)
pip freeze | grep matplotlib
sudo pip3 install --upgrade matplotlib

Edited third run calibration complete values into magCalSlider.py

The slider program showed YZ to be not centered around 0,0 - 
adjusting Y Bias to -95 and Z Bias to -135 centered the YZ
adjusted Y Scale to 0.95 to make shape circular roughly 200 by 200 

YZ is the horizontal plane where Carl lives, YZ being centered and circular is goal
Adjusted Y Bias to center YZ green blob
Adjusted Y Scale to get YZ green blob circular at 200 x 200

XY and XZ do not appear circular because calibration motion was limited in roll and pitch
while doing figure eights in horizontal yaw plane

Values result: 
bias 165, -95, -135
scale 1.40, 0.95, 1.05
